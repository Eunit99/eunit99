# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Eunit99 ( *Emmauel* *Uchenna* )

I am Emmanuel Uchenna, freelance ``chat bot developer`` | ``web developer`` | ``web designer`` | ``frontend developer`` | ``graphic designer``

I am a seasoned frontend web developer. **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **Javascript**, **jQuery**, **VueJS**, and **ReactJS** are my web development tools. I am familiar with responsive design techniques, approaching all projects with a mobile-first view, ensuring that what I produce will look great regardless of the type of device it is being viewed on.

I love creating websites and also programming. This is all my motivation pushing me to improve my skills in multiple disciplines such as: UX design, UI design, frontend development, I think these are just the titles for companies. For me it is the path for turning ideas into live applications.
